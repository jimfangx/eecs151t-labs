# Lab 3) Exploring Your Own Side Project!

## Overview

In the Lab 2 sequence, you integrated your EECS151 core into an SoC, in a very guided manner writing minimal RTL and trying to learn from existing work. This lab will much more loosely guide you through the process of starting a new front-end (RTL) project - for example, writing a peripheral. You can follow along or embark on your own side project journey. 

This lab is optional, in the sense that you can work on another project if you'd like as an alternative - especially if you'd rather be working on interrupt handling, cache coherency, and other microarchitectural topics or verification or physical design oriented side projects. **[Gradescope]** **Either way, submit to the Gradescope so we know what you're up to and what progress you've made!**

## Part 1: (A More Complete) Chipyard Tour 

Here we seek to provide a top-down view of Chipyard to contextualize the internals you've been playing around with in Lab 2. Use it as a reference sheet and to figure out what other hardware is available for your experimenting! :D We won't ask you questions about this.

### Chipyard in a Blurb

Chipyard is an **integrated design, simulation, and implementation framework** for open source hardware development developed (here!) at UC Berkeley. It is open-sourced online and is based on the Chisel and FIRRTL hardware description libraries, as well as the Rocket Chip SoC generation ecosystem. It brings together much of the work on hardware design methodology from Berkeley over the last decade as well as useful tools into a single repository that guarantees version compatibility between the projects it submodules.

A designer can use Chipyard to build, test, and tapeout (manufacture) a RISC-V-based SoC.
This includes RTL development integrated with [Rocket Chip](https://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/rocket_chip.html), cloud FPGA-accelerated simulation with [FireSim](https://fires.im/), and physical design with the [Hammer framework](https://hammer-vlsi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

As you learned in Lab 1, Chisel is the primary hardware description language used at Berkeley. It is a domain-specific language built on top of Scala. Thus, it provides designers with the power of a modern programming language to write complex, parameterizable circuit generators that can be compiled into synthesizable Verilog. 

Your side projects will likely take the form of an SoC constructed within the Chipyard framework, so it's a good idea to understand the framework through-and-through.

There is a lot in Chipyard so we will only be able to explore a part of it in this lab, but hopefully you will get a brief sense of its capabilities. 

Note that while we talked about the *Rocket Chip* ecosystem (distinct from the Rocket Tile and Rocket Core) in lecture, *Chipyard* (the name) is often used near interchangeably, and we will say *Chipyard* from now on.

### Chipyard Repo Tour

> <b>You will mostly be working out of the `generators/` (for designs), `sims/vcs/` (for simulations)* and `vlsi/` (for physical design) directories.</b> 

> VCS is a proprietary simulation tool provided by Synopsys while Verilator is an open-source tool. There are some subtle differences form the user perspective, but VCS is usually faster so we'll be using that throughout the course. Everthing done with VCS can easily also be done in Verilator (the subdirectory structure is the same as well). If this changes, we will let you know.

You may have noticed while initializing your Chipyard repo that there are many submodules. Chipyard is built to allow the designer to generate complex configurations from different projects including the in-order Rocket Chip core, the out-of-order BOOM core, the systolic array Gemmini, and many other components needed to build a chip. 

Thankfully, Chipyard has some great documentation, which can be found 
[here](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

You can find most of these in the `$chipyard/generators/` directory.
All of these modules are built as generators (a core driving point of using Chisel), which means that each piece is parameterized and can be fit together with some of the functionality in Rocket Chip (check out the [TileLink and Diplomacy references](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/TileLink-Diplomacy-Reference/index.html) in the Chipyard documentation).

**In Summary**

- Configs describe parameterization of a multi-generator SoC.

- Generators are flexible, reusable library of open-source Chisel generators (and Verilog too).

- IOBinders / HarnessBinders enable configuring IO strategy and Harness features.

- FIRRTL Passes are a structured mechanism for supporting multiple flows.

- Target flows support different use-cases for different goals (primarily simulation and synthesis/physical implementation).

A good way to prevent information overload is to map these ideas to the actual repository. Try exploring small configs! As we discussed in Lab 2, `Config`s describe what generators make up our final system and what parameters they are are elaborated with. You can find the configs in `$chipyard/generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/config`.

## Part 2: Side Project Idea: Creating a Brand New (Digital) Peripheral!

There are many interesting SoC adventures you could choose from, but maybe after looking through the above, you decided to work on peripherals. This lab will loosely guide you through integration of a UART peripheral - even though [UART, GPIOs, SPI, I2C, PWM, etc.](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip-blocks/tree/c8c14f7b47c3c790022c293bc7e4309f5c5ed523/src/main/scala/devices), are already part of Chipyard - but you could follow similar steps to integrate an MMIO accelerator, brand new peripheral, or a multitude of other projects.

### TileLink MMIO Peripherals

There is a guide for doing MMIO peripherals [here](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Customization/MMIO-Peripherals.html). You will notice its examples are actually for hardware that computes a Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). Notice too this part of the documentation: 

> To create a RegisterRouter-based peripheral, you will need to specify a parameter case class for the configuration settings, a bundle trait with the extra top-level ports, and a module implementation containing the actual RTL.

Despite the different application, this is quite similar to what you've done before! 
Follow the steps as outlined in the documentation to set up your new peripheral:

- Create submodule(s) that perform the logic that you desire (such as processing UART transactions). (You can start off with a dummy class and return to it later.)

- Create a class that creates the registers and hooks them up using `regmap` (since this is MMIO).

- Connect through TileLink by extending the `TLRegisterRouter` class and passing in arguments (ignore any examples referencing `AXI4` - we are only using the TileLink protocol here).

- Set up the `LazyModule` trait that runs setup code that must execute before all the hardware gets elaborated. (For a simple memory-mapped peripheral, this just involves connecting the peripheral’s TileLink node to the MMIO crossbar.) Remember the difference between a `LazyModule` and the implementation class.

- Add your peripheral to DigitalTop. (We will mention a bit more about this in a second)!

- Create a Configuration class. 

Unlike the prior labs, we leave it up to you to leverage what you've learned to figure out how to exacly do these steps! The following information may help..

### DigitalTop, ChipTop, Top Top!

We mentioned `DigitalTop` briefly in Lab 2, mostly ignoring it. We mentioned that the three highest levels of hierarchy in a Chipyard SoC are the ChipTop (DUT), TestHarness, and the TestDriver. The ChipTop and TestHarness are both emitted by Chisel generators. The TestDriver serves as our testbench, and is a Verilog file in Rocket Chip. You should glance at the documentation [here.](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Advanced-Concepts/Top-Testharness.html#)

When you run a `make` command, whether it's for simulation, the VLSI flow, FPGAs, etc, Chipyard will these generate four files - TestDriver, TestHarness, ChipTop, and DigitalTop - along with the rest of your chip. These instantiate each other heirarchicaly as shown below, with TestDriver being at the top for simulations.

````

| TestDriver                                    |

| | | _____________________________________ | | |
| | | | DigitalTop                        | | | |
| | | | (Rest of your chip)               | | | |
| | | |                                   | | | |

````

`DigitalTop` is the innermost "top" file which contains all of your instantiated blocks and their digital signals. It's called DigitalTop because this is where all of your digital IP will live. 

`ChipTop` is the top level of the Chip you eventually tape out and instantiates any Analog IP such as PLLs and IO Cells and connects them to the corresponding pins in DigitalTop so that they can talk to the outside world. By default, the connections between DigitalTop and ChipTop is mediated by the `IOBinders` which can be found at `generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/iobinders/IOBinders.scala.`

The `IOBinders` are responsible for instantiating the IO cells for ChipTop IO that correspond to IO of the System. The `HarnessBinders` are responsible for instantiating test harness collateral that connects to the ChipTop ports. Most types of devices and testing collateral can be instantiated using custom IOBinders and HarnessBinders.

Note we may use synthesizable IO Binders when doing physical design and simulation-only IO Binders in verification.

**Why is this important to you?** In addition to following the MMIO peripheral steps, you will need to figure out IO for your new peripheral!

If you take the 4-unit Tapeout course, you can learn much more about this, for example through this [lab (NDA locked)](https://bwrcrepo.eecs.berkeley.edu/ee290c_ee194_intech22/digital-lab4-sp25/-/blob/main/ee194-lab/advanced_concepts/cy_top_hierarchy.md?ref_type=heads). 

### Peripheral Logic - UART?!

Above we wrote the following:

- Create submodule(s) that perform the logic that you desire (such as processing UART transactions). (You can start off with a dummy class and return to it later.)

However, you can't keep the class a placebo forever! We chose UART as our example for this lab because you may be familiar with it from EECS151 labs (especially if you took FPGA) and because there is a SiFive implementation already in `rocket-chip-blocks` for you to reference. 

Feel free to reference [this EECS151 lab](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eecs151/sp25/static/fpga/lab4/) for a refresher on ready-valid interfaces and the UART protocol. This lab guides you through a UART implementation in Verilog. Now we see the same peripheral in Chisel!

The ready-valid interface is a standardized interface and protocol for timing-agnostic data movement between 2 modules. The ready-valid interface is used to send data from a source to a sink.

![](Lab_3_assets/sink_source.png)

UART is a 2-wire protocol with one wire carrying data from the workstation → SoC and the other one carrying data from the SoC → workstation. A typical setup used in EECS151 looks like:

![](Lab_3_assets/high_level_diagram.png)

You can read more about the `rocket-chip-blocks` implementation [here](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Generators/Rocket-Chip-Generators.html). In fact, you can even "cheat" and look at the SiFive source code [here](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip-blocks/tree/main/src/main/scala/devices/uart). You will notice their more robust UART has multiple optional settings. However, the Rx and Tx might look a little familiar. Your implementation can be much simpler! 

**Why is this important to you?** Whether you (re)implement UART, or endeavor the path less traveled integrating a new peripheral into Chipyard, you need to understand your peripheral interface and how it should behave.

## Yes, There's Testing..

Up until now, we've been avoiding writing anything new that requires verification. As you embark on this new project, verification is no longer an afterthought! 

The last part of the [MMIO peripherals guide](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Customization/MMIO-Peripherals.html) provides an example of C testing. Because UART is already implemented in Chipyard, there is an existing TestHarness you could use to test your peripheral as long as you keep your IO interface true to the existing UART implementation.

We briefly mentioned `TestHarness` above.`TestHarness` contains simulation/verification IP that hooks up to your simulated `ChipTop` when running simulations so that you can connect to the chip, load programs onto it, and test out any peripherals. This can include complicated IP like simulated memory or bringing UART print statements to the console. This is controlled using `HarnessBinders` which can be found at `generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/harness/HarnessBinders.scala.`

We haven't yet talked much about testing. If you follow the UART example, you can use the existing TestHarness.

**Why is this important to you?** Regardless of what you're doing, you should be able to verify your new IP! Plan your verification strategy in advance. What approach will you take? 

### Simulation Commands

When your new `Config` with your new peripheral is ready, you can simulate your SoC with a command like:

```
> cd $MCYDIR/sims/vcs
> make CONFIG=MyCoolSoCConfig
```

(Note as mentioned in Part 1, this example uses VCS, but there are other simulation tools available!)

As you'll see in the verification lab, You can also pass in binaries to be loaded into memory (and subsequently read out of memory over TileLink):

```
> # build test binaries
> pushd tests
> make 
> popd

> cd sims/vcs
> make CONFIG=TutorialLeanGemminiConfig \
    BINARY=../../tests/pwm.riscv \
    run-binary-hex-debug

> make CONFIG=TutorialLeanGemminiConfig \
    BINARY=../../tests/mt-hello.riscv \
    run-binary-hex-debug

> make CONFIG=TutorialLeanGemminiConfig \
    BINARY=../..//tests/mt-gemmini.riscv \
    run-binary-hex-debug

```

This may be useful if you are working on a more complex side project. In this case, the Configs are referring to the Gemmini DNN accelerator generator. The target `run-binary-debug` automatically generates the waveform file for a specific test. This will generate waveforms you can use to debug and verify your core and SoC. 

Recall you can also run physical design flows by running `make CONFIG=MyCoolSoCConfig` commands in `vlsi/` with targets like `syn`, `par,` `drc`, and `lvs`. This is for more advanced stages of your side project. 

**Why is this important to you?** A verification plan is nice, but you need to know how to run it!

# Summary

This exploratory lab provides very loose guidelines for a possible side project - integrating a TileLink MMIO peripheral - with UART as a specific implementation example. It summarizes a variety of hardware available for Chipyard users to integrate into their own SoC projects. In addittion, it provides more context for IO and digital top-level integration, particularly relevant to those doing front-end (RTL) side projects. 

The overall goal of this lab is to motivate more open ended exploration and freeform hands-on experience. Please submit on Gradescope the direction and results of your experiments, regardless of whether you follow this UART peripheral example or not.
