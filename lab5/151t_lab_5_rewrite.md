# Lab 5: Physical Design

We've spent the last labs and lectures diving into all of the awesome infrastructure available for designing SoCs,
taking you from Chisel, a higher-level HDL embedded in Scala, all the way through composable SoC components abstracted behind config fragments.

One large consideration remains, however:
how do we make this all real?

The course, so far, has been concerned with the generation & writing of RTL, which is a **behavioral description** of what we want our circuit to do.
There are no polygons, no timing paths, just _intent_.

Physical design, which will be explored in this lab, is the process of taking that intent (RTL) and turning it into an equivalent (but manufacturable) physical layout!

This lab will contain some theory, they mainly act as supplemental to the lecture material and can be also used as reference. If you know what is going on for a particular topic from lecture coverage, feel free to skip those theory sections, otherwise **please read the theory sections; otherwise you may find yourself to be very lost in later sections**. 

# EECS151LA Review
EECS151LA's lab 4 has a very well-written overview on [PaR](https://github.com/EECS150/asic-labs-sp24/tree/main/lab4).
We highly encourage you read the lab's prose (and not just skip to the questions like you might have if/when you took the course).
For the sake of ensuring that everyone is on the same page, some of the following content will be repeated from EECS151-LA lab 4 (or other labs), and some might look similar but be a little bit different from what you saw in EECS151.

# [FYI] Theory: CAD Tooling
VLSI/PD uses lots of tools and tools have unintuitive names. Here is a table. Very similar to what you probably saw in EECS151, but updated to be more complete.
[Aside: the following technically includes simulation tools, which technically is not part of PD, but this is good information to have.]

The big 3 EDA (Electronic Design Automation) companies are Cadence, Synopsys, and Siemens. Together, they pretty much hold 100% of the market share for the VLSI EDA space.

|  | Synopsys | Cadence | Siemens | Open-Source
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RTL Simulation | VCS* | Xcelium | Questa (formerly Mentor ModelSim) | Icarus Verilog, Verilator
| RTL-Power | PrimePower RTL, SpyGlass | Joules | PowerPro-RTL | - |
| Synthesis | FusionCompiler (Design Compiler) | Genus | Oasys-RTL | Yosys Open Synthesis Suite
| Place & Route | FusionCompiler (IC Compiler II) | Innovus | Aprisa | OpenROAD (OpenLANE for SkyWater 130nm) |
| Physical Layout (for Full Custom Analog/Digital), Analog/Mixed-Signal IC | Custom Compiler | Virtuoso | L-Edit^ | - |
| Gate Level Power | PrimePower | Voltus | PowerPro | - |
| DRC/LVS/Physical Verification | IC Validator | Pegasus | Calibre | Magic [Developed at Berkeley!], KLayout
| Parasitic Extraction (PEX) & Signoff | [Synopsys Signoff](https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/signoff.html#products) | [Certus Closure Solution](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/resources/datasheets/cadence-certus-closure-solution-ds.html) (Includes Innovus, Pegasus, Quantus & Tempus) | Calibre | OpenRCX, KLayout

\* Note about VCS: VCS is the simulator, the waveform viewer you may have used in EECS151 is called DVE (â‰ VCS). DVE is old, industry primarily now uses [Verdi](https://www.synopsys.com/verification/debug/verdi.html) for waveform viewing (photo [here](./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/verdi.png)) if they are in the Synopsys ecosystem for RTL simulation.

^ Note about L-Edit: you might also see names such as Tanner L-Edit or Mentor L-Edit - They are the same thing.

# Theory: The SkyWater 130nm PDK & Standard Cells
You might've used the SkyWater 130nm PDK in EECS151 if you took the ASIC lab, however, the lab specs don't fully cover everything about the PDK you need to know for a successful tapeout; so this is the supplemental to it.

First, a clarification: a PDK (Process Development Kit) typically includes the process technology data, process primatives, DRC and LVS decks; however, depending on the supplier, they might not include digital standard cell libraries.
* Process/Technology here refers to SkyWater 130nm. There are many different processes/technologies: SkyWater 90nm, GlobalFoundries 180nm, Intel 16 (AKA: Intel 22FFL), TSMC 16, etc.
* Process primatives here refers to symbols, device parameters, Parameterized Cells (PCells) for analog design; Technology data means SPICE models for transistors, capacitors, resisters, inductors, etc.
* Standard Cells here refer to basic digital logic blocks such as AND, OR, NOR gates in prebuilt blocks supplied by the foundry for building digital designs. For more see [A Closer Look at the Standard Cells](#a-closer-look-at-the-standard-cells).

To prevent any confusion, we will refer to **PDKs as the process primatives** and **Standard Cells as the digital standard cell library**.

## SkyWater 130nm Stackup
<img src="./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/metal_stack.jpg" height="700px">

Every PDK has a document or drawing similar to the one above. It is a documentation from the foundry describing how materials (like Silicon, Oxides, Metals) are stacked up in that manufacturing process. It also contains specifications that dictate the thickness of each metal layer, the distance required between metal layers, etc.

For the most part, you do not need to completely understand the diagram. While violating the parameters on this diagram (ex: misconfiguring the minimum distance between metal layers in your VLSI tool setup) will result in DRC violations or errors during the place & route flow, those errors will give you more information on a) what numbers to look for, b) where to look for them, c) what the numbers you are looking at do and how they affect your VLSI flow.

Your job here is to understand and build a mental image of this process. When you see the layer "metal 1" you should know that the "li" (local interconnect) is right below it and that there is a connection "mcon" (metal contact) connecting them together.

You should start building this intuition so that when you see, for example, an error saying two pieces of metal are placed too close to each other near `via M1M2_PR_R`, you know to turn off all other layers other than Metal 1, Metal 2 and Via 1 in Innovus (you shouldn't even need to know what a via is at this point, the M1M2 name along should be enough of a hint). Having the stack up in your head and being able to figure out what layers to look at vs. to disregard will make your PD life a lot easier since you can quickly triangulate a problem to a few limited sections of your chip and ignore the other overwhelming amounts of information.

Additionally, developing the intuition that a chip is like a layered cake/city and that signals coming from the outside world will be introduced to the chip at higher metal layers and will need to be routed down through the metal layer stack to contact the transistors, and vice-versa -- signals from the transistors that need to travel to another part of the chip or to the outside world (off chip) will need to be moved up from the bottom of the chip (where the transistors are located) through the metal layers.

<details>
<summary>I tried including as much as I know about the acroymns in the photo here if you are curious:</summary>
nwell -> section of the substrate that has been n-type doped

licon -> local interconnect contact

li -> local interconnect

mcon -> metal contect


FOX K=3.9 -> Field Oxide (SiO2), Dielectric Constant = 3.9

PSG -> Phosophosilicate Glass (Doped with phosphorus)

SPNIT -> Silicon Nitride Spacer

IOX -> I/O (aka: Gate) Oxide

## A Closer Look at the Standard Cells
Standard Cells are the fundamental building blocks of a digital design containing fundemental logic blocks such as AND, NOT, OR gates, Clock Buffers, Muxes, etc. They are placed and connected up in a digital design to build the logic that you have described in your Verilog/Chisel.

<img src="./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/std-cell-example-AND2X1.png" width="1200px">

Here is a SkyWater 130nm Standard Cell. This one in particular represents a 2-input AND gate (named: `AND2X1` -- do you remember seeing something like this in your EECS151 ASIC post-synthesis netlist?)

### Characterizing a Standard Cell: Describing it to the VLSI tools
We have this nice visual graphic of the standard cell, however, we need to tell the CAD tools a bit more -- where are the input ports of this cell? where are the output ports? where to connect power to? ground? how big is the cell? etc...

Given 1 standard cell like the AND2X1 above, there are different "views" of that standard cell. Looking at `/home/ff/ee198/ee198-20/sky130_col/sky130_scl_9T_0.1.2/sky130_scl_9T` we see the following folders, each representing a different set of information about the standard cell:

```bash
$> ls /home/ff/ee198/ee198-20/sky130_col/sky130_scl_9T_0.1.2/sky130_scl_9T

$> cdl  dspf  gds  lef  lib  oa  pgv  spectre  verilog
```

#### **CDL: Circuit Design Language**
* A netlist description of the standard cell, usually generated by a tool from the schematic of that standard cell when it was designed.
* It is similar to a SPICE netlist and is used in circuit simulation and **LVS** (will discuss later)

#### **LIB: Liberty Timing Files**
.lib files: Liberty Timing Files are timing libraries generated by the foundry that contains timing, area and power information for standard cells.

For the SkyWater 130nm Process, Liberty Timing Files can be found at `/home/ff/ee198/ee198-20/sky130_col/sky130_scl_9T_0.1.2/sky130_scl_9T/lib`. Each file represents a different corner -- for what this means, see the [Synthesis//Generate MMMC Section](#2-writegenerate-mmmc-multi-mode-multi-corner-views-then-read-in-mmmc-files).

#### **OA: openAccess Format**
* View of the standard cell and its schematic in openAccess (formally Genesis) format. This format is mainly used so these (Cadence designed) standard cells can be opened in other tools.
* Read more about openAccess here and how it was never meant to be open: https://semiwiki.com/eda/606-openaccess/

#### **PGV: Power-Grid View**
* Modeling/Characterization of the power delivery network of the standard cell. These files contain the cell's geometries and parasitic numbers that are required for power/IR/ESD analysis.
    * IR / IR Drop analysis = The power delivery network on a chip is made up of metal stripes. Metal has resistance too, and as power flows through the chip's metal stripes to the standard cells, it will lose voltage. This means that some standard cells may receive less voltage than others/amount originally applied. The amount of voltage drop that occurs is called the IR drop.
    * ESD analysis/verification = Verify that there are no potential unintended electrostatic discharge paths that can cause damage to the chip when it contacts very high static voltages (think your hand after rubbing your feet on the carpet)
* These files exist since we can reuse some of this power data across multiple designs that use the same standard cells instead of having the power/parasitic analysis tools recalculate everything from scratch.


#### **Spectre: Cadence Spectre SPICE Simulation Model**
* Another format similar to the CDL format used for SPICE circuit simulation. A snippit for the AND2X1 cell is in the drop down below - notice how similar it looks to the CDL.

#### **Verilog View:**
* A Verilog module describing the behavior and timing information of that cell is provided for the synthesis tools to understand the logical behavior of the cell when synthesizing your behavioral Verilog to a gate-level netlist, for use during gate-level simulation, and can help simulators determine timing correctness as well.

This is the Verilog model for that same AND2X1 cell -- this should be fairly self-explanatory what the behavior of it is:
```Verilog
// type: AND2
`timescale 1ns/10ps
`celldefine
module AND2X1 (Y, A, B);
	output Y;
	input A, B;

	// Function
	and (Y, A, B);

	// Timing
	specify
		(A => Y) = 0;
		(B => Y) = 0;
	endspecify
endmodule
`endcelldefine
```

### Physical Cells: Antenna Diodes, Fillers, DeCaps, Tie Cells, Taps Cells, Power on Reset (PoR)
There are some special standard cells/macros that don't represent logic but are essential to a digital design. These are called "Physical Only Cells" ("PhyCell").

Physical Only cells do not appear on timing path reports and do not contain any logic. They are purely there for manufacturability reasons and to ensure DRC compliance.

The files for these cells are available here: `/home/ff/ee198/ee198-20/sky130_col/sky130_scl_9T_0.1.2/sky130_scl_9T_tech` if you want to follow along.

<img src="./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/sky130-phycell-example.png">

#### **Antenna Diodes & The Antenna Effect:**
* Antenna diodes are included to prevent the antenna effect that occures during fabrication.
    * Antenna Effect: an effect that occurs during the fabrication process that can render a die useless.
        * During manufacturing (specifically, [plasma etching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_etching), a form of [dry etching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_etching)), charge is deposited onto metal lines/interconnects. These metal lines can be connected to the polysilicon gates of transistors and also can be left floating during parts of the manufacturing process before other upper metal layers are deposited.
      * These unconnected metal lines will sit there and collect charge throughout the manufacturing process.
      * Charge built up on these lines can suddenly discharge into the gate of the transistor, which causes gate oxide breakdown => broken transistor => broken chip.

      ![antenna_effect](./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/antenna_effect.gif)
    * Antenna diodes are reverse biased diodes that leak charge to ground to prevent the charge from going into the transistor's gate.
        * This results in higher parasitic capacitance (resulting in a slower circuit) and higher leakage power (higher static power) on that net.

        ![antenna_diode_insertion](./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/antenna_diode_insertion.gif)

        ![antenna_diode_charge_flow](./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/antenna_diode_charge_flow.jpg)
* Antenna violations are checked using a physical verification tool (Will discuss more during the DRC section) with a deck that has rules on the maximum allowed ratio between metal-interconnects to gate area allowed ("antenna ratio").
<!--TODO: LINK DRC SECTION-->
* Antenna diodes, for the most part, is automatically inserted by Innovus during the Place & Route flow. (See lines 42 & 43) of the TCL in the [Place & Route section](#4-tool-settings)

<details>
    <summary>Other ways to prevent the antenna effect</summary>
1. Metal Hopping / Jumper Insertion: Break the lengthy metal interconnect into small pieces using jumper interconnects/wires to other metal layers so that a piece of interconnect never gets lengthy enough to collect enough charge to break down the transistor's gate oxide.

* The advantage of this is avoiding the higher parasitic capacitance and leakage power associated with a diode, however, it comes at a cost of potentially more congestion in the upper metal layers of the design & an increase in the number of [Vias](#characterizing-the-entire-processtechnology-technology-lefs) between metal layers placed.

    ![antenna_alt_jumper](./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/antenna_alt_jumper.jpg)

2. Dummy Transistor Insertion: Increase the effective gate area of the transistor by adding a dummy transistor next to the transistor that you originally placed. This decreases the ratio between metal-interconnects to gate area. The downsides of this is quite obvious: more dummy transistors = less area for useful logic + more power consumed.
    ![antenna_alt_dummy_transistor](./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/antenna_alt_dummy_transistor.jpg)
</details>


#### **Fill Cells & Digital Design Fill, Decoupling Capacitors:**
* Fill cells are often used to fill in the area in your digital design where there are no logic standard cells. By filling those empty spaces with filler cells, it ensures that all power nets throughout your circuit are connected.
* Fill cells have no logic in them. Although, sometimes the free area in a fill cell is used to add decoupling capacitors to a digital design.
    * _Decoupling capacitors_ help stabilize the power supply network. They store charge and respond to any sudden current requirements in the power delivery network. Without these capacitors [power droop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_droop) or [ground bounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_bounce) may occur and affect the constant power supply and as a result, power supplied to the standard cells.

* A design without fillers will likely result in (DRC) errors. Particularly if you fail to place fillers, it'll likely result in a `nwell minimum spacing not met` DRC violation. This is because of the Well Proximity Effect.
    * The result of the Well Proximity Effect is that doping level at the edges of [nwells](#skywater-130nm-stackup) tends to be different than the doping level at the middle of the nwell. This means, for consistency, we want to have as large of a nwell as possible, which is created through having devices sit right next to each other. ([More Information](https://analoghub.ie/category/Layout/article/layoutDependentEffects#WPE))

        <img src="./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/Well_Proximity_Effect.jpg">

    * Having gaps in your design (due to a lack of filler cells) will result in chunks of different nwells throughout the design, which results in more devices sitting at the edge of nwells, and more devices suffering from this doping inconsistency.
   * It's also a headache for the fabrication house...
   (More masks to create space for the gaps in your design)

* NOTE: You might hear about a fill script or metal fill later in the signoff stage. Fill cells are not the same as this fill script or metal fill.

Design with Fill Cells:
![](./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/fill_cell_in_design_example.png)

Design without Fill Cells:
![](./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/fill_cell_not_in_design_example.png)

#### **Tie Cells:**
* Special purpose cells that outputs either high (TIEHI) or low (TIELO).
* We have these cells to act as the intermediary between the input and the gate of the transistor. We don't directly connect the input to the gate of transistors as supply ligthces can damage the transistor.
    * The power grid is connected through tie cells and the output of these tie cells are then connected to the gate of transistors.

#### **Tap Cells:**
* Tap cells are cells with no logic but they tie nwell to VDD and p-substrate to VSS.
* Without tap cells, a design can suffer from Latch Up, where a short-circuit is formed between the power supply rails, and once formed, it'll continue to short circuit in a positive feedback loop until device shutdown. Here's an example:

<img src="./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/latchup.jpg">
Let's take this inverter as an example. The Parasitic BJT structure is created and once $R_{NWELL}$ and $R_{sub} = R_{substrate}$ create enough voltage drop during a trigger event, the parasitic BJT structure turns on, then feedsback into itself, connecting VDD with ground until there is absolutely no current flowing through it -- which typically doesn't happen until the device is fully powered down. 

[More Information](https://analoghub.ie/category/Layout/article/layoutDependentEffects#Latchup)

The fix for this is to hold nwell to VDD and substrate to ground, so that voltage drop never happens and a positive feedback loop can never sustain itself. This is what tap cells do.

Some older Standard Cells have tap cells integrated into its logic standard cells, in which case you won't see a Tap Cell under its Physical Cells list. However, newer processes have moved the Tap Cell out to its own cell in order to save area in the logical standard cells.
* An additional set of (DRC) rules checks for latch-up compliance and tap cells are inserted as needed to resolve these violations. (Will discuss more during the DRC section).

<!--TODO: LINK DRC SECTION-->

The Cadence SkyWater 130nm Standard Cells (SKY130_SCL) has built in tap cells in its logic standard cells.

##### **Power on Reset:**
* A block that generates a reset signal that propagates through the entire chip so everything is set to a predefined state. It is essentially a giant RC network:

<img src="./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/power-on-reset-signal-vs-vcc-ramp-up.png" width="400px">
    
<img src="./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/PoR_innovus.png" width="1200px">
A PoR doesn't necessarily connect to all standard cells - Remember they don't have a reset signal! In this case it connects to almost all the IO Cells to reset inputs to our chip to a known state.


Note: You should ensure that you don't include the PoR in timing paths. (Why?^)

^: The PoR is not part of the timing of the chip; It'll likely always be the critical path as it is a signal that propagages through the entire chip.

### Characterizing the entire Process/Technology: Technology LEFs
Common other names of Technology LEFs: "Tech LEFs", ".tlefs"
* These contain information regarding the process as a whole (information about the stackup) -- diffusion layer, poly-silicon layer, metal interconnect information, Via information, possible placement sites ("classes") and their dimensions.
    * "information" = minimum spacing between metal lines, via width, spacing requirements, sheet resistance information for different metal layers and vias.

* Some concepts that you might find helpful to know:
    * `via`: Via is a hole in the dielectric layer that connects two metal layers. It is used to connect metal lines that are not adjacent to each other.
    * Metal layers have directional preferences - in this case, metal 1 prefers horizontal connections, while metal 2 prefers vertical connections.
    * For what the syntax of the Tech LEF means, see [the Cadence LEF/DEF Manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11f-7cCzddl_lga5LUSpBbYsDdlnHN7bO/view?usp=drive_link)

# Theory: Inputs/Outputs of each VLSI Step
We've heard about the different tools for each step... What do these tools take in terms of input & what do they output? This section should help you understand flow of how your design goes from RTL to a GDS.

A thing to keep in mind: These tools are controlled by a scripting language called TCL (pronounced "tickle"). Each tool has its own set of commands that can be called within a TCL file. These commands are the primary way digital designers control these VLSI tools. These commands look like terminal commands where you have a command like `cp`, followed by some flags and arguments. TCL files have the file extension `.tcl`. We will talk about how to write TCL to control these tools in a later section; this is just a heads up so you don't get confused when you see these commands in the following few sections.

## Synthesis
Broadly, synthesis follows the following flow:

If you would like some code as reference, the synthesis TCL script can be found at the following location (after running synthesis at least once):
`${CY}/vlsi/build/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.<your config>-ChipTop/syn-rundir/syn.tcl`

### 1. Write/Generate SDCs
SDCs or Synopsys Design Constraint files should either be manually written or generated by some tool.

SDC files contain design timing information (special cases, restrictions, etc), creation of clocks (and clock dividers, clock inverters, etc), I/O pin constraints such as defining external load capacitance connected to a top level port, among other things. (For more detail, read [this](https://signoffsemiconductors.com/introduction-to-sdc/)).


<!-- TODO: give example of actual hammer yaml -->
At Berkeley, we have a tool called [Hammer](https://hammer-vlsi.readthedocs.io/) that generates the SDC commands for us, and automatically writes them to a SDC file according a some specifications we defined in a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Example) configuration file. We will discuss Hammer in a later section, but if you are curious, the source code that generates these SDC commands is [here](https://github.com/ucb-eecs151tapeout/ofot-hammer/blob/0f5388ed185e52254bfabe7c127b73aedfd26d90/hammer/vlsi/hammer_vlsi_impl.py#L2183-L2284).

You can find the SDCs your synthesis process used at `${CY}/vlsi/build/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.<someConfig>-ChipTop/syn-rundir/clock_constraints_fragment.sdc` and `${CY}/vlsi/build/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.<someConfig>-ChipTop/syn-rundir/pin_constraints_fragment.sdc`

### 2. Write/Generate MMMC (Multi-mode, Multi-corner) Views, then read in MMMC files
The process of doing this at a high level is:
1. Read SDC Files
2. Read in `.lib` files
3. Create MMMC corners

MMMC Corners: Multi-mode, Multi-corner views attempt to cover all real world environments where your chip may be used in, then provide this information to the tool, so it can accurately provide timing information.
Modes are defined by different functional modes that your chip will operate in (high-performance, low-power, etc.) -- This is reflected by different supply voltages and timing constraints.
Corners represent a set of data that attempts to capture variations in the manufacturing process (specifically higher and lower carrier mobilities in NMOS & PMOS -- Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_corners#FEOL_corners)) and how they will impact performance of the chip, along with how variations in voltage and temperature of the surrounding environment that your chip will operate in will change timing and other parameters.

You can find the script that your synthesis run used to generate MMMC corners at `${CY}/vlsi/build/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.<someConfig>-ChipTop/syn-rundir/mmmc.tcl`

### 3. Read in LEF files
LEF files includes rules and specifications about the standard cells and metal interconnects. Both Standard Cell LEFs and Technology LEFs are read in at this stage.

If you are not sure what these terms mean, refer to the [Characterizing a Standard Cell: Describing it to the VLSI tools](#characterizing-a-standard-cell-describing-it-to-the-vlsi-tools) and [Characterizing the entire Process/Technology: Technology LEFs](#characterizing-the-entire-processtechnology-technology-lefs) sections.

### 4. Read in RTL
This step is pretty simple: the synthesis tool reads in all of the RTL that makes up your design! One of these files should be your top-level Verilog file.

### 5. Sanity Checks
The tool then runs a sanity check on the design and timing specifications.
This involves making sure that there is no combinational loops, multidriven nets, etc and that there are no missing clock definitions, missing information for the I/O ports, multi-clock driven registers, etc.

### 6. Generic Mapping
In EECS151 Lab 3's words:
> This step is the generic synthesis step. In this step, [the synthesis tool] converts our RTL read in the previous step into an intermediate format, made up of technology-independent generic gates. These gates are purely for gate-level functional representation of the RTL we have coded, and are going to be used as an input to the next step. This step also performs logical optimizations on our design to eliminate any redundant/unused operations.

For Cadence Genus, this step is identifiable by the command `syn_generic` being run.

### 7. Technology Mapping
> This step is the mapping step. [The synthesis tool] takes its own generic gate-level output and converts it to [technology]-specific gates. This step further optimizes the design given the gates in our technology. That being said, this step can also increase the number of gates from the previous step as not all gates in the generic gate-level Verilog may be available for our use and they may need to be constructed using several, simpler gates.

For Cadence Genus, this step is identifiable by the command `syn_map` being run.

### 8. Optimization
Optional step, where the TCL command `syn_opt` is called for the tool to perform some further optimizations.

### 9. Add Tieoffs
> In some designs, the pins in certain cells are hardwired to 0 or 1, which requires a tie-off cell. This step adds these cells.

Here is an example of the TCL script telling Cadence Genus which gates/standard cells are to be used for tieoff, and then calling Genus to add the tieoffs:

```
set HI_TIEOFF [get_db base_cell:TIEHI .lib_cells -if { .library.library_set.name == $ACTIVE_SET }]

set LO_TIEOFF [get_db base_cell:TIELO .lib_cells -if { .library.library_set.name == $ACTIVE_SET }]

add_tieoffs -high $HI_TIEOFF -low $LO_TIEOFF -max_fanout 1 -verbose
```

### 10. Generate Reports
> Generates post-synthesis reports on area, utilization, timing, runtime, etc

Note: Most of these reports will not be particularly accurate since they don't take into account routing congestion, wire delay, clock tree delays and clock skew, which the Place & Route flow takes into account. So post-synthesis reports should be used for a ball park reference only.

### 11. Write outputs
Writes the results of the synthesis flow. This includes gate-level Verilog, a SDC file for the post-synthesis design, a .sdf (Standard Delay Format) file containing timing information (path delays, timing constraints for checks)

Here is the TCL (note, paths are different here) for writing the 3 different output files:

```
write_hdl > ${CY}/vlsi/build/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.<your config>-ChipTop/syn-rundir/ChipTop.mapped.v

write_sdc -view ss_100C_1v60.setup_view > ${CY}/vlsi/build/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.<your config>-ChipTop/syn-rundir/ChipTop.mapped.sdc

write_sdf > ${CY}/vlsi/build/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.<your config>-ChipTop/syn-rundir/ChipTop.mapped.sdf
```

You can view the 3 written files at the file paths above as specified in the TCL script.

## Place & Route

Continuing from synthesis, here is what is involved in the Place & Route process:

The reference TCL script is available here: `${CY}/vlsi/build/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.<your config>-ChipTop/par-rundir/par.tcl`

This section will heavily rely on you reading [EECS151 ASIC Lab 4's Place and Route section](https://github.com/EECS150/asic-labs-sp24/tree/main/lab4#place-and-route). If you haven't read it before or forgot the contents, please re-read it.

### 1. Read LEFs
* Reading in Standard Cell & PDK LEFs - See [this section](#3-read-in-lef-files).

### 2. Read MMMC
* See [this section](#2-writegenerate-mmmc-multi-mode-multi-corner-views).

### 3. Init Design
Initializes the design with context of your synthesized Verilog netlist, LEF, name of power net, name of ground net, CPF file, MMMC file.

### 4. Tool Settings
A series of commands that tell Innovus to behave a certain way during the flow (when it runs placement, optimization, CTS, routing, etc).

You most likely won't know what each individual command does -- and that is OK! We as staff don't even remember. Luckily there is a manual that tells you what these things do. We will cover how to read this (very long) manual in the [TCL Scripting Applied] Section.

### 5. Read Power intent
> Reads in CPF file [Common Power Format] A CPF file contains information about power domains in the design (voltage, names, groups, etc)

You can take a look at the CPF that our flow reads in at `${CY}/vlsi/build/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.<your config>-ChipTop/par-rundir/power_spec.cpf` after your first Place & Route run. You will see that it is creating different power nets (1.8v, 3.3v), connecting IO cells that take in power to the correct power domains, assigning specific IO cell pins to different power nets.

### 6. IO Fillers
For our IC design, I/O cells are found at the {top, left, right, bottom} edges of the chip in order to allow our chip to interface with the outside world.

^ If this concept is foreign to you, see the first photo in the [Floorplanning section of EECS151-LA Lab 4](https://github.com/EECS150/asic-labs-sp24/tree/main/lab4#floorplanning).

However, it is not a great idea to have our I/O cells directly touching each other (exercise for the reader: why?*). So we need to insert special "I/O fillers" between the different I/O cells. What this exactly looks like on our chip is best illustrated with photos:

1. Overview of our entire chip/"die" (just to give you some context -- this view should be familiar to you already from EECS151 ASIC Lab 4)

<img src="./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/par-io-fillers-chip-overview.png" height="500px">

2. If you look towards the left of the photo & we zoom in, you can see the IO cells and IO fillers and how they fit together:

<img src="./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/par-io-fillers.png" height="500px">


\*: Electrically speaking, it makes keeping the circuitary of each IO cell separate a lot more difficult, and this may result in unintended shorts, unintended crossing of power domains, etc. From a physical perspective, having each IO port be so close to the other ones can cause problems/difficulty when we attempt to connect wires to the chip to interact with the other components off chip. We'll discuss more how exactly our chip is connected with components off chip in the [die area, io rings, available area, packaging overview] section.

### 7. Add Core (Power) Rings to Chip
We then draw a ring around our chip, between the actual wires/logic and our IO cells. This ring carries power and ground signals around the chip, so that we can use it as a source for when we draw our horizontal and vertical power straps across our chip. We will talk about why we need these horizontal & vertical power straps in the next section, but the tl;dr is: it enables us to get power to each standard cell, or logic that requires power.

Conceptual photo, the ring that is labeled "Rings" is what this step of P&R draws:

<img src="./Lab_5_assets_rewrite/par-core-ring-concept.png">

Here is a photo from an actual SkyWater 130nm design that shows the Core Ring, how power is fed into it and how power is drawn from it for the rest of the chip's logic:
