# Lab 1a) Chisel  Bootcamp

## What is Chisel - and why Chisel?

In EECS151, you learned the HDL (hardware description language) Verilog.  Much of Berkeley research and _some_ industry uses the increasingly popular HDL Chisel. If you've taken EECS251B or EECS194 Tapeout, you have already been to exposed to Chisel and have heard this shpeel.. if not, this background segment is for you!

### (A More Critical) Verilog Background

**Verilog** was invented in the 1980s as a simulation language. Synthesis was an afterthought.  Around the same time as the origin of Verilog, the US Department of Defense developed **VHDL** (A double acronym! VSIC (Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit) HDL). Because it was in the public domain it began to grow in popularity. Afraid of losing market share, Cadence opened Verilog to the public in 1990.

Verilog is the language of choice of Silicon Valley companies, initially because of high quality tool support and its similarity to C-language syntax. The latest Verilog version is “**System Verilog**”. VHDL is still popular within the government, in Europe and Japan, and some universities.

However, because Verilog was developed as a simulation language, it has many limitations that arguably System Verilog does not fully solve. 
* Many constructs don’t synthesize: `deassign`, timing constructs..
* Others lead to mysterious results: for-loops..
* It is difficult to understand synthesis implications of procedural assignment (`always` blocks), and blocking versus non-blocking assignments.. 
* Verilog has very weak “meta-programming” support for "compiling" circuits..

Many companies "solve" this with employee rules, lint style checkers, embedded TCL scripting.. Berkeley proposes Chisel as an alternative solution.

### Chisel: Constructing Hardware In a Scala Embedded Language

**Chisel** is an experimental attempt at a fresh start to address these issues. Through this lab you will learn how to use its basic set of design construction primitives. But Chisel's biggest claim to fame is its “meta-programming” support for building circuit **generators**.  You will soon learn those as well. 

Chisel is based on **Scala**, which allows integration of functional programming, object oriented programming, strong typing, and type inference into the HDL. Chisel can generate a high-speed C++-based cycle-accurate software simulator, or low-level Verilog designed to pass on to standard ASIC or FPGA tools for synthesis and place and route. You don't need to worry about each of these details.. 

TL;DR, **Chipyard** (which you will learn about in part B of this lab) is written in Chisel. Therefore, we will use Chisel in this class.

## Learning Chisel 

Instead of reinventing the wheel, we will make use of the existing **Chisel Bootcamp** to introduce ourselves to Chisel. 

**(1) Read through the Chisel Bootcamp introduction.** 

You will find our fork of the Bootcamp at:
``https://github.com/ucb-eecs151tapeout/eecs151t-chisel-bootcamp``

We will have some conceptual questions regarding Chisel on Gradescope.

**(2) Launch the Chisel Bootcamp Jupyter notebook instance.** 

The guide is under "Getting Started". There's a local setup version, but the environment is not the easiest to setup, so we recommend the notebook.  (Note that the notebook Chisel environment is a bit different from the Chipyard Chisel environment, so you *may* run into bugs in the future... Sorry.)

**(3) Go through Modules 1-3 of the Bootcamp.** 

You may want to go through Gradescope in parallel, as we'll want you to submit Chisel examples.  If you're a Chisel expert, you can skip the Bootcamp and just do the Gradescope - that's totally fine. If you're new, you'll find the Bootcamp should make the Gradescope assignment pretty easy.

Module 4 (FIRRTL) is interesting but optional. Note that FIRRTL has undergone major changes that we're pretty sure are not yet reflected in the Bootcamp.  

**(4) Fill out the Chisel part of Lab 1 on Gradescope.**

If you haven't already!

## Using Chisel 

Having a Bootcamp is nice, but you likely won't remember everything you did once you dig into Chipyard.. You can use the Bootcamp for reference. You can also use a much more compact [cheat sheet](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs250/sp17/handouts/chisel-cheatsheet3.pdf), such as:
 ![https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs250/sp17/handouts/chisel-cheatsheet3.pdf]
In practice, Chipyard implements a lot of unique Chisel constructs that are best learned by working on Chipyard itself. So don't stress too much about this part and feel free to move on to part B even if you don't feel like a Chisel expert!

# Lab 1b) Chipyard Setup

## Background: Chipyard

As seen in lecture and the [Chipyard repository](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard)..

> Chipyard is an open source framework for agile development of Chisel-based systems-on-chip. It will allow you to leverage the Chisel HDL, Rocket Chip SoC generator, and other [Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu/) projects to produce a [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) SoC with everything from MMIO-mapped peripherals to custom accelerators. Chipyard contains processor cores ([Rocket](https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip), [BOOM](https://github.com/riscv-boom/riscv-boom), [CVA6 (Ariane)](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/)), vector units ([Saturn](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/blob/main/saturn), [Ara](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/blob/main/ara)), accelerators ([Gemmini](https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini), [NVDLA](http://nvdla.org/)), memory systems, and additional peripherals and tooling to help create a full featured SoC. Chipyard supports multiple concurrent flows of agile hardware development, including software RTL simulation, FPGA-accelerated simulation ([FireSim](https://fires.im/)), automated VLSI flows ([Hammer](https://github.com/ucb-bar/hammer)), and software workload generation for bare-metal and Linux-based systems ([FireMarshal](https://github.com/firesim/FireMarshal/)). Chipyard is actively developed in the [Berkeley Architecture Research Group](http://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/) in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu/).

For now, just know that Chipyard is a collection of open source projects that will help us develop our system-on-chip (SoC). Like Chisel, it is frequently found in Berkeley research and occasionally in industry. Each class introduces Chipyard a little differently. In EECS151T, we will focus on aspects most relevant to integrating our EECS151LA CPU cores into the SoC. 

If you ever need more resources:
- [Chipyard repository](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard)

## Chipyard Setup

We will now set up your Chipyard environment. 

**(1)** **First, accept the GitHub classroom assignment using the link provided by staff.** 

It will look something like: ``https://classroom.github.com/a/LETTERSHERE``

**(2) Once your personal repo is created, copy down the SSH clone URL.**

Don't clone Chipyard locally.  For this course, you must work in the `/scratch` directory on a lab machine of your choice. Since `/scratch` is not automatically backed up, you will need to login to the same server each time. Chipyard will generate too much data for it to fit in your home directory.

**(3) Make sure you know your instructional account login.**

*(These instructions are very similar to [EECS151 Lab 1](https://github.com/EECS150/asic-labs-sp24/tree/main).. Review that lab if you need a refresher on using instructional machines.)*

You may need to generate an instructional account:
1. Visit WebAcct: [http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/webacct](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/webacct).
2. Click "Login using your Berkeley CalNet ID"
3. Click on "Get a new account".

Once the account has been created, you can email your class account form to yourself to have a record of your account information. You can follow the instructions on the emailed form to change your Linux password with `ssh update.eecs.berkeley.edu` and following the prompts.

As of this writing, we are still figuring out these accounts, so please post questions if you run into issues. Like EECS151, the servers used for this class are most likely primarily `eda-[1-12].eecs.berkeley.edu`.

You can check which machines are available at: [https://hivemind.eecs.berkeley.edu/](https://hivemind.eecs.berkeley.edu/).

**(4) Login to a lab machine over SSH.**

*(These instructions are very similar to [EECS151 Lab 1](https://github.com/EECS150/asic-labs-sp24/tree/main).. Review that lab if you need a refresher on using instructional machines.)*

Note: If you are off-campus (or off the EECS network), you may need to use the GlobalProtect VPN for these steps.

**SSH is the preferred connection because most work will be performed using the terminal and should be used unless a GUI is required**. The SSH protocol also enables file transfer between your local and lab machines via the `sftp` and `scp` utilities. **WARNING: DO NOT transfer files related to CAD tools to your personal machine. Only transfer files as needed.**

How To:

- Linux, BSD, MacOS  
    
    Access your workstation through SSH by running:
    
    ```shell
    ssh USERNAME@eda-X.eecs.berkeley.edu
    ```
    
    In our examples, this would be:
    
    ```shell
    ssh USERNAME@eda-8.eecs.berkeley.edu
    ```
    
- Windows  

	The classic and most lightweight way to use SSH on Windows is PuTTY ([https://www.putty.org/](https://www.putty.org/)). Download it and login with the FQDN above as the Host and your instructional account username. You can also use WinSCP (winscp.net) for file transfer over SSH.
    
    Advanced users may wish to install Windows Subsystem for Linux ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), Windows 10 build 16215 or later) or Cygwin (cygwin.com) and use SSH, SFTP, and SCP through there.

**(5) Optional (but please, please do) - use tmux!**

It is _**highly**_ recommended to utilize one of the following SSH session management tools: `tmux` or `screen`. This would allow your remote terminal sessions to remain active even if your SSH session disconnects, intentionally or not. Below are tutorials for both:

- [Tmux Tutorial](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/)
- [Screen Tutorial](https://www.rackaid.com/blog/linux-screen-tutorial-and-how-to/)

> [!WARNING]
> If you run commands in a "raw" (without `nohup` or `tmux`) SSH terminal, they will be killed when you exit your session (or if your wifi goes out for a few seconds).
> 
> To use [`tmux`](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/), you can add `RemoteCommand tmux new -A -s ssh` to your ssh config for your instructional account or run `tmux new-s -t <name>` once you log in. (Reference the tutorial above if you're confused.)
> 
> You can also run a command `cmd` as `nohup cmd` to prevent the command from being killed if the session exits, but this is less convenient.
> 
> If you manually created a `tmux` session, you must reattach to it manually the next time you log in with `tmux a -t <name>`.

Whenever you enter an SSH session, you should start or attach to a `tmux` session. 

**(6)** **Run the commands below in a `bash` terminal.**

During the `bash Miniforge3.sh` and `./build-setup.sh` commands, say "yes" and press enter when prompted.

First, create your `/scratch` directory and install `conda`:

```
mkdir -m 0700 -p /scratch/$USER
cd /scratch/$USER
wget -O Miniforge3.sh \
"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3.sh -p "/scratch/${USER}/conda"
```

Then, setup your repo.

```
source ~/.bashrc
git clone <YOUR SSH CLONE URL> # i.e. git@github.com:ucb-eecs151tapeout/<semester>-chipyard-<username>.git
cd <semester>-chipyard-<username>
git remote add skeleton https://github.com/ucb-eecs151tapeout/<semester>-chipyard.git
git pull skeleton main
mamba install -n base conda-lock=1.4
mamba activate base
git config --global protocol.file.allow always
```

**(7)** **Run the commands below in a `bash` terminal.**

The following will add necessary binaries like `firtool` to the path.

```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ff/eecs251b/tools/install/bin/
export LM_LICENSE_FILE=5280@license-srv.eecs.berkeley.edu:2100@license-srv.eecs.berkeley.edu:1717@license-srv.eecs.berkeley.edu
```

These next scripts may take a very long time (potentially over 30 minutes). Don't forget to `tmux`!

```
./build-setup.sh riscv-tools -s 6 -s 7 -s 8 -s 9 -s 10
source env.sh
./scripts/init-vlsi.sh sky130
```

If you get ``Permission denied`` errors, remember to generate or copy over your SSH key as described in the Prelab.

The TL;DR of these commands is that you now have a working Chipyard environment! 

> [!TIP]
> More specifically, these scripts are responsible for setting up the tools and environment used by the course.
> 
> - Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that allows you to quickly install, run, and update packages and their dependencies. In other words, conda allows users to create an environment that holds system dependencies like make, gcc, etc. We need to activate this conda environment.
> - We use commercial tools such as VCS from a common installation location. We add this location to the path and source relevant licenses.
>
> The shell script will initialize and checkout all of the necessary git submodules. When updating Chipyard to a new version, you will also want to rerun this script to update the submodules. Using git directly will try to initialize all submodules; this is not recommended unless you expressly desire this behavior.
>
> git submodules allow you to keep other Git repositories as subdirectories of another Git repository. For example, the above script initiates the rocket-chip submodule which is its own Git repository that you can look at here. If you look at the .gitmodules file at top-level chipyard, you can see
>
> [submodule "rocket-chip"]
>	path = generators/rocket-chip
>	url = https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip.git
> which defines this behavior. Read more about git submodules here.
>
>Feel free to look at the scripts themselves if you want to learn more.

> [!CAUTION]
> `hammer-synopsys-plugins` and `hammer-mentor-plugins` are private repos. PLEASE DO NOT PUBLISH THEM PUBLICLY.

### Using the environment

To enter your Chipyard environment, you will need to run the following command in each terminal session you open (including new `tmux` sessions).

```
source /scratch/$USER/chipyard/env.sh
```

This env.sh file should exist in the top-level repository. This file sets up necessary environment variables such as PATH for the current Chipyard repository. This is required by future Chipyard steps such as the make system to function correctly.

You may also need to change these environmental variables anew in every session you're running VLSI flows in:  

```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ff/eecs251b/tools/install/bin/
export LM_LICENSE_FILE=5280@license-srv.eecs.berkeley.edu:2100@license-srv.eecs.berkeley.edu:1717@license-srv.eecs.berkeley.edu
```

> [!TIP]
> If you would like to run this automatically on terminal startup, you can add the command to your `~/.bashrc`
> by running the following:
>
> ```
> echo "source /scratch/$USER/chipyard/env.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
> ```

Optionally, you can also set the repo path as an environment variable by running `export chipyard=/scratch/$USER/chipyard`.

If you'd like to hone your bash skills, help your peers out, and get some extra credit.. try making a `~/.bashrc` file for the class to use with all of the necessary exports. 

### Common issues

If you completed the setup successfully, you can skip this section.

#### `hammer-mentor-plugins`-related errors

These should've been removed from this version of Chipyard, as `hammer-mentor-plugins` is a private repository. If you run into bugs, particularly during the `./build-setup.sh` step, let us know.

(If you feel adventurous, you can also try fixing the problem yourself by removing `hammer-mentor-plugins` from all `.gitmodules` and the `.sh` script, but you may need to reclone Chipyard if you make some breaking changes...)

#### `build-setup` transaction failed

If you observe that the `conda` install transaction failed, which is often caused by stopping `./build-setup` prematurely, you will likely need to reinstall conda. To do so, reinstall `conda` by running the following commands:

```bash
cd /scratch/$USER/chipyard
rm -rf .conda-env
cd ..
rm -rf conda
bash Miniforge3.sh -p "/scratch/${USER}/conda"
source ~/.bashrc
```

After running the above commands, go through the repo setup instructions again (you do not need to delete and re-clone the chipyard repo).

#### Hanging on `configure: configuring default subproject`

This might happen if you try to run the installation without `unset`ing the `CONFIG_SHELL` environment variable.
To resolve it, run the following from the Chipyard root directory:

```
unset CONFIG_SHELL
source env.sh
./build-setup.sh riscv-tools -s 1 -s 2 -s 6 -s 7 -s 8 -s 9 -s 10 --force
```

This skips the steps that have already completed prior to the failure and retries the failed step.
Proceed as usual after the command succeeds.

## Your first VLSI run!

From the `vlsi` folder, run:

``make lvs tutorial=sky130-commercial``

Don't worry too much about what it's doing right now (although you're always welcome to read through the files.) This is just to make sure your repository is setup right.

Don't forget to complete the Gradescope check-in, and let us know on Discord if you run into any issues!
