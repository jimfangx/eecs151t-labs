# EECS151T-Labs

Lab manual for EECS 151T Tapeout, particularly focused on the 151T One Fifty One Tile (OFOT) Project. 

# Course Info

EECS151 Tapeout is a Decal (student-run course) giving a hands-on, end-to-end experience in SoC design and implementation culminating in a tapeout.

Students with a background in the fundamentals of digital design and VLSI CAD tools (EECS151 + ASIC lab) will learn how to use the Chisel hardware description language and Chipyard (an agile hardware design framework) to integrate their EECS151 ASIC core or a custom IP block of their own design into a full-scale System-on-Chip (SoC). While covering the basics of agile SoC design concepts and methodology, the course is primarily a hands-on experience. One (or more, depending on student interest) class SoCs are planned to be taped out in the open-source Skywater 130nm process at the end of the semester. Extra chip area is available for motivated students with unique, large-scale projects.

The course aims to give all students hands-on experience in every step of the SoC design process from system-level design (interfaces, modular decoupling), to toplevel integration and physical design with commercial CAD tools though Berkeley’s Hammer tool. Students will participate in a class project consisting of one or more physically realized and fabricated SoCs in the open-source Skywater 130nm process node. Student contributions to the designs may range from a chipyard-integrated version of their EECS 151 ASIC core to custom accelerators or off-chip peripheral interfaces. It is emphasized that while multiple students may collaborate on a single SoC (or even within a module), every student will receive hands-on experience with the full tapeout process, from system architecture to GDSII signoff.

This course spans 13 weeks. Class meets for two hours once a week. Each class will generally consist of a short mini lecture, overview of project status, and check-ins with each team on milestones and obstacles. Students are expected to spend a bit more time each week outside of class time working on their project. The semester will culminate in chip tapeout through Efabless’ chipIgnite, student presentations, and a class poster.
