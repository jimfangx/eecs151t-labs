# Lab 5: Physical Design

We've spent the last labs and lectures diving into all of the awesome infrastructure available for designing SoCs,
taking you from Chisel, a higher-level HDL embedded in Scala, all the way through composable SoC components abstracted behind config fragments.

One large consideration remains, however:
how do we make this all real?

The course, so far, has been concerned with the generation of RTL, which is a **behavioral description** of what we want our circuit to do.
There are no polygons, no timing paths, just _intent_. 

Physical design, which will be explored in this lab, is the process of taking that intent (RTL)  and turning it into an equivalent (but manufacturable) physical layout!

# EECS151LA Review
EECS151LA's lab 4 has a very well-written overview on [PaR](https://github.com/EECS150/asic-labs-sp24/tree/main/lab4).
We highly encourage you read the lab's prose (and not just skip to the questions like you might have if/when you took the course).
The following sections assume that you have read the linked lab content, and will focus on the following physical design considerations not covered in 151: 

* Toplevel IO
* Power Domains
* Signoff

# Input/Output (IO)
In order to interact with the outside world (as most useful chips do), we need to define an interface between the internal nets of an SoC and the 'nets' (usually PCB traces or discrete wires) external to it.
This interface is realized through the use of so-called "IO" (input/output) cells on the SoC that are, through the SoC's [package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit_packaging), exposed to the outside world.

**[Gradescope] Identify a property that might be useful in an IO cell that wouldn't be necessary in a non-IO cell.** (Hint: think about what scary or non-standard things come from off-chip!)

IO on a chip comes in two major flavors: pads and bumps.
Pads are connected to the package via wire bonds, whereas a chip with bumps can either be wire-bonded or "flipped" and directly soldered onto the package substrate (a substrate is essentially a PCB with tighter tolerances).
Check out the lecture on manufacturing to learn more!
You can find the lecture folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g8HB1NtqkX3s_v_RFG-lzUnx5HByMj9o).
Below is a visual idea of the differences between pads and bumps.

![Packaging](Lab_5_assets/packaging.png)

For this tapeout, we will be using a ring of pads (a "pad ring") that surrounds our chip.
This strategy is both convenient to wire-bond to and allows us to have a contiguous IO ring for our chip supplies, visualized below.

## IO Cell Library

Just like designers (or, more accurately, CAD tools) use a standard cell library for implementing digital logic,
we will use an IO library to implement our design's interface to the outside world.

We will be using the Sky130 IO library [sky130_ef_io](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/tree/master/sky130/custom/sky130_fd_io),
which is an Efabless (RIP :() addendum to the SkyWater I/O library [sky130_fd_io](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/contents/libraries/sky130_fd_io/docs/user_guide.html#i-o1-common-features).

Warning: the sky130\_fd_io documentation may be inconsistent or out of date with what's used.
We're confused too a lot of the time- a lot of configuration is set up over many iterations of trial-and-error (and slacking people who've tried and error-ed before).
That's the beauty of abstraction!
Once an opaque configuration issue has been solved, its solution can be easily integrated into others' projects.

One important functionality that the IO cell layout provides is [ESD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge) protection.
This is particularly critical when these pins will be connected to unknown (and potentially dangerous) sources of electricity from the outside world.
Even though your IO cells have ESD protection, you should still ground yourself when working on them!
There's nothing worse than frying a chip because you didn't feel like putting on a cool [bracelet](https://www.amazon.com/iFixit-Anti-static-Wrist-Strap-Adjustable/dp/B00B2T9C8Y) when working on it :(.
These 'ESD clamps' are effectively diodes that shunt high voltage spikes to be absorbed by the power rails, instead of your thin signal routing.

The library contains many GPIO cells, but here are a couple of particular interest
* `sky130_ef_io__gpiov2_pad_wrapped` is the default, workhorse digital pad. They have a spec-ed bandwidth of 66MHz (see the Sky130 IO Library docs linked above for more specs), and are generally what we use in standard SoC design
* `sky130_ef_io__analog_pad_esd2` provides an analog interface to the outside world and support potentially higher bandwidth digital systems (although they require custom drivers/receivers)

In addition to signal pads, we need to connect supply busses (rails). Here are the busses supported by this IO library (i.e. nets present in the IO ring):

* VDDIO: an (optionally isolated) supply for off-chip interactions (i.e. to supply the IO pad drivers)- generally 3.3v (although it can be set to 1.8)

* VSSIO: an (optionally isolated) ground for I/O interactions

* VDDA: an (optionally isolated) supply for on-chip analog devices

* VSSA: an (optionally isolated) ground for on-chip analog devices

* VCCD: an (optionally isolated) supply for on-chip digital devices (generally 1.8v, the VDD of the default transistors in sky130)

* VSSD: an (optionally isolated) ground for on-chip digital devices

Remember that VSS means ground (0v) and VDD/VCC is the supply (i.e. usually max) voltage of the region it supplies.

**[Gradescope] You'll notice that these supplies are optionally isolated.
Even if, for example, VDDA and VCCD had the same voltage, why might we still want to isolate them?**

`sky130_fd_io` uses overlays (i.e. added wires) on top of generic power/ground cells to determine which supply trace on the power ring to connect a given IO pad to.
`sky130_ef_io` has pre-defined overlay + generic cells, such as `sky130_ef_io__vccd_lvc_clamped3_pad`.
Thanks, Efabless!

As we will see, Innovus needs special instructions to place these power cells, since they aren't explicitly instantiated through `IOBinder`s as signal IO cells are (see the following section for an introduction to `IOBinder`s).

## IOs in Chipyard (Elaboration + Synthesis)
In order for our design to utilize the IO cells discussed above, they must instantiated (along with what they connect to) in the netlist (i.e. in the RTL).
Chipyard uses functions called [IOBinder](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Customization/IOBinders.html)s to instantiate IO cells and connect them to internal SoC signals.
You can find wrappers defined for the sky130\_ef_io cells we'll use in `generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/sky130/Sky130EFIOCells.scala` within your Chipyard repo.
Check out `Sky130EFIOCellTypeParams` for instantiations of the cells that could be used by our design (`analog`, `gpio`, etc.).

Take a look at the `HasSky130EFIOCells` trait that's included in `WithSky130ChipTop`, which our `OFOTConfig` uses.
This is where the magic happens: for each `toplevel` port (ports are created by fragments in the config such as `WithUARTAdapter`), an `iocell` is instantiated, registered and connected to the port.
This allows the concept of 'toplevel' ports in RTL to be decoupled from how they are realized (by being mapped to a physical IO cell for physical design, for example). 

**[Gradescope] IO Cells aren't the only thing ports map to! What's a use-case aside from physical design for these port objects?** (hint: think simulation)

## IO Maps in Innovus (Physical Placement)

We need to tell our place-and-route tool (here, Innovus) where to put the IO cells for the signals we've attached `IOBinder`s to as well as, where to put power pads to bring power to our IO ring.
We do this through an "IO map", generated by a script called `gen-io-file.py`, located in `vlsi/scripts`.
An "IO map" in Innovus is a list of io cell nets and their placement coordinates.
The map also includes cell names (such as the `sky130_ef_io__vccd_lvc_clamped3_pad` mentioned above) when they aren't inferable from the RTL.
This occurs, for example, with power pads which aren't explicitly instantiated in the RTL.
It takes in a yml of the desired IO configuration (which cells to put where),
and is executed by `vlsi/Makefile` as a dependency for the flow when the `IS_TOP_RUN` variable is true.
The `IS_TOP_RUN` variable in `vlsi/Makefile` decides when to generate this IO map,
and is set to `1` by default but is disabled for `tutorial=sky130-commercial` flows, since they do not need IO pads.
In addition to placing signal (and extra, such as filler) IOs based on the yml,
the script also generates IO placements for the supply busses, so we can provide VCCD VSSD, etc. to our chip.

**[Gradescope] Give the path to the yml that gen-io-file.py is looking for (hint: look in the `Makefile`). What would you have to add if you increased the Serial TileLink bus width?**

Once you've run `make CONFIG=OFOTConfig par`, you should see an `io_map.io` file in your `vlsi/build/<config>`.
Open it up, and take a look inside!
You'll notice that signal `inst`s don't have explicit `cell`s attached (just a placement),
since the RTL already provides a reference to the cell,
whereas supply cells do,
since they will be inserted manually.

**[Gradescope] What's the point of placing corner/filler IO cells? They don't provide any pads/IO...**

Open up `par.tcl` from your build folder's `par-rundir`, and you'll see the IO map read in by Innovus, followed by some `global_net_connect`s, an `add_ring` and a a `route_special`.

This instantiates the IO cells from the map file, draws a [power ring](https://www.physicaldesign4u.com/2020/01/power-planning.html) around the inner design, and connects both the IO ring's supplies and the SoC's power grid to it.

**[Gradescope] Why do we need a power ring? Why do we even need a power grid at all? Can't we just route power nets like any other?**

## Power Domains in PD Tools


You might also remember above that our IO ring has multiple voltage supplies (and even multiple grounds)!
CAD tools keep track of these through 'power domains'.
You'll notice in this section of the `par.tcl` that multiple power domains (HV and AO) are referenced when connecting pins on power nets such as VDD, VSS, and VDDIO.
Power nets exist in power domains, and you can view the definition for the OFOT SoC's power nets and domains in `vlsi/ofo.cpf`. 
Power domains allow tools to separate reasoning about things like IO interfaces from things like the power grids for internal digital logic.
It's also used to inform and tune power optimizations for resource-constrained designs.
Note that the IO cells operate at two voltages (VDD and VDDIO).
This is possible because they have special internal level-shifting circuits that allow them to buffer between the CMOS digital logic at VDD and outside world at VDDIO.

## Running a toplevel par
Run `make par CONFIG=OFOTConfig` (optional: use your custom `CONFIG`!).
This will place-and-route the RTL elaborated by Chipyard (including your EECS151LA core!), as well as handle toplevel IO and power connections.
You can take a look at the design by `cd`ing into `vlsi/build/<config>/par-rundir/generated-scripts` and running `./open_chip` from a GUI remote session (like instrdp).
This invokes the Innovus GUI and loads the `latest` database.
Hammer automatically makes `pre_<step>` and `post_<step>` checkpoints when running tools- `latest` is a symlink created by hammer to the most recent checkpoint.

**[Gradescope] Submit a screenshot from the Innovus GUI of a placed-and-routed OFOTConfig, or a config of your own creation!**


Note that you'll need to modify the pin map yml if you extend OFOTConfig with more port-creating fragments.
That is, if your added Chipyard config fragments want to send signals off chips (they create `port`s), you'll need to tell Innovus where to place them (in the pin map yml).

Also note that there will likely be a ton of white `x`s all over your design- these are Innovus DRV (design rule violations), and _may_ correspond to DRC errors in signoff.
The mapping is not 1:1, however, since Innovus doesn't actually have access to the DRC deck (a list of rules supplied tool vendors in collaboration with the foundry about what is and is not manufacturable), it uses approximations to true DRC rules such as LEF provided spacing rules and vague approximations of antenna ratios. 
These approximations may be based on process-specific information that innovus _does_ have (such as the afformentioned LEFs), or generic node-based estimates (a 'node' is just the x in <x>nm in the technology name).

You might be wondering: how did all of the SRAMs get magically placed in a very regular and structured way?
Unfortunately, there is no magic: only `vlsi/design-ofo.yml`, which contains placements for both the Rocket Core and EECS151LA core SRAMs.
In classes like EECS151 or EECS251B, you might have had to change these placement coordinates- if you change the `CONFIG` (or during your side project), you'll probably have to do that!
Here, though, the benevolent 151T staff have placed the macros for you :)

**[Gradescope] Which core (the Rocket Core supervisor or 151LA) dominates the chip area?**
(hint: macros such as SRAMs associated with cores usually dominate chip area)


Pro tip: here's a (scuffed) strategy to get initial macro placement yml.
One of the most annoying things is initially finding the macro names, so this can be very nice :)

run `make par CONFIG=<yourconfig> HAMMER_EXTRA_ARGS="-p stop_after_step=floorplan_design"` to have Innovus slap down all the unplaced macros.

Run `./open_chip`, in `build/CONFIG/par-rundir/generated-scripts` to open your chip in the Innovus GUI.

Note that you can move macros around with the `Move/Resize/Reshape` tool accessed in the top left of the window, or by hitting `Shift + R`.
Activate the tool, then click on a macro (like an SRAM) to move it around.

To get the current macro placements in hammer-compatible `yml` format, run

`get_db insts -if {.base_cell.class == block} -foreach {puts "- {path: [get_db designs .name]/$obj(.name), type: hardmacro, x: $obj(.location.x), y: $obj(.location.y), orientation: $obj(.orient)}"} `

in the `innovus>` terminal created in the executing terminal window.

## Signoff
Once we've placed-and-routed our design, we must make sure it matches our RTL (LVS) and is manufacturable (DRC)!
This is the process of 'signing off' the chip.

Run `make drc CONFIG=OFOTConfig` to run Pegasus DRC signoff on your design.
Side note: if you only want to rerun a specific step without Hammer trying to be smart about rerunning `syn`,`par`, etc. as dependencies, you can run `redo-<step>`, e.g. `redo-drc` if you change the DRC ruledeck but not the design.
Read more [here](https://hammer-vlsi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Hammer-Use/Buildfile.html).
Note that you'll need to run `redo-par-to-drc` if you want to run `redo-drc` right after a `par`.

The design will likely not be clean- this is likely not your fault! The DRC deck that Cadence has provided is not up-to-date, and Cadence will ship a new one soon(tm).

**[Gradescope] Find a DRC violation reported by Pegasus and take a screenshot of where in the layout it's occuring. Is it within a macro (such as an SRAM or IO cell) or normal logic?**

Run `make lvs CONFIG=OFOTConfig`.
This will check for equivalence between the layout's devices and their connectivity and the schematic (e.g. elaborated RTL).

**[Gradescope] Submit your LVS results- if LVS crashed, submit a screenshot and try to explain why it did. Otherwise, run `./lvs-rundir/generated-scripts/view_lvs` and submit a screenshot of the LVS results.**

Note that some cells (such as IO cells or SRAMs) might be 'blackbox'ed for DRC or LVS.
Blackboxing in the context of signoff is essentially a promise to the tool that the cell is 'clean', and can be ignored during checks.
This can hide obvious issues in the design, but is sometimes necessary for special, exception-case IP blocks that have been approved by the foundry but are not 'clean' according to the decks.
LVS blackboxes can also be used for when the deck extracts connectivity incorrectly, such as with some analog blocks including very large resistors.

Note that 'blackboxing' is a general concept related to a cell with a defined interface and opaque internals/implementation- blackboxing RTL is different than blackboxing in signoff!

# Summary

In this lab, you went through the whole physical design flow from elaboration and synthesis to place and route,
getting your dream SoC ever closer to reality.
In practice, physical design is often a very iterative process,
with multiple PaR runs being done over and over again before all constraints are met and the design is considered reasonable. 
hile make commands make your life much easier, it's important to understand what's happening under the hood when the tools time out,
finish with violations, or constraints turn out to be paradoxical.
Before sending your design to the fab,
you will need to make sure you address these issues and get your design DRC-clean (for the fab) and LVS-clean (for yourself).
We want to see DRC and LVS clean designs submitted for our chips too!
